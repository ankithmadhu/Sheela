            <div class="letter-box">
                Dear Sheela,
                <br><br>
                You came into my life once Debin introduced me to you, and from then I have been with you quite often. I still remember the day I met you for the first like introduced each other, when you were out for a walk with Sheenu, it was just a Hi Bye, but I had seen before during some razi event where you were dancing the heart out and I really loved how you were enjoying yourself. Then we met when I came in between internship and had good conversation throughout the internship when I was having a very bad phase of life. Later, throughout your comprehensive I was so happy that I could help you in some sort.
                <br><br>
                In between that time I had a small feeling for you, but I thought you were with someone and didn’t want to take the friendship to worse.  Then came a time when out of blue on Feb 16 out of nowhere you told me you like me, and if say I was literally like how the universe has come along like this. And my response to it has not come just like that, in my mind I had thought about all the things that might come on the way, and I also kept myelf promises that I will do going forward along with telling you. Then all the conversation we had during that time I got to know you more the person you are and along the way bonded so much. As you say, we kind of think the same way and that really tend to understand you are taking things and of course it would be same with you, that’s something that eases out with you.
                <br><br>
                It's been one year. And my love for you has only increased in multiples of infinity. I know you have different things in your mind, things you fight within and many more, I may not have solutions for all the things... but all I can assure you is that you will never be alone in any of those fights, I will be there with you giving my 1000%. Also to enjoy your successes in your life together, I know there’s goanna be a lot coming on the way and I would love to cherish all those celebrate the heart out on those.
                <br><br>
                I am never here to judge you by your past or anything, all look for is a future with you. I know it's pretty hard for you to tell anything and it been with you all time, I have seen you running away from me all the time and I completely get you, but this was something I would regret if I don’t open up. I can always assure that I will be safe space for you. All the time you ask me why I am off you kind of know what it was and I did not wanted to put you in a spot, I always would love to see you happy and will do whatever I can to make it stay. I tried had to move on, I cann’t and keep coming back to you.
                <br><br>
                You are such a gem of a person who anyone would want in their life, for being for people whom you care a lot without even expecting anything, you being understanding of things, putting your heart out in things you are doing, the resilience that you show etc.. etc.. I just love you for the person you are the pack of energy cell, the cutu looks, little pagal person you are, the independence you attained. I like it all. And you tick off any of the boxes I would ever wanted to find in a person. I cherish all the moment we spent together and love to have more of it.
                <br><br>
                I know the next question from you would be "what do you want me to do?" I can't force someone, to be in a love with me or something. Atleast may be try if it could be possible..
                <br><br>
                And chill saas le..
                <br><br>
                Anyway things go you will be my first priority and it will remain the same.
                <br><br>
                And in the end I just wanted to say
                <br><br>
                <p class="highlight-line">
                    I LOVE YOU SO MUCH SHEELA
